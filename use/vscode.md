# Quick Start with Imbricate VSCode Extension

Install the extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=imbricate.imbricate).

Note that, you should also have the Imbricate CLI installed, as a supplement to the extension. See [Quick Start with Imbricate CLI](/use/cli) for how.

## Why Imbricate CLI?

The VSCode Extension doesn't support some of the features that the CLI does. For example, the CLI can render pages and templates, and manage origins.
